1. Changes to code constraining for INIT: there were bugs when verb not participating in extraposition were not constrained for the default value. Rewrote and simplified the function that constrained lexical items for INIT.

2. Review case frame situation: for Turkish, makes sense to leave transitive verbs case-unspecified and then have the agreement markers introduce both FORM (finite or, if zero marker and not 3SG, nonfinite/subjunctive) and the case requirement for the subject (nominative or accusative).
