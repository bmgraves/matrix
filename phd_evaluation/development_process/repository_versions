This file provides information on the repository versions that can be used to create grammars with the choices files listed in the choices directory.

Grammars can be created with versions of CLIMB created later than the choices file, but not necessarily the other way around.


The main purpose of this information is to allow external users to replicate teh results presented in Fokkens (2013).
