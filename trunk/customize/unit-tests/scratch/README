This directory is meant as a sandbox for use in the process of
creating unit-tests.  It is a good place to store your choices and
txt-suite files that you pass to create-unit-test() (invoked in the
lisp buffer with the lkb running).  Nothing in this directory should
be under cvs control, other than this README file.
