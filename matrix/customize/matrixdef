example, a language may distinguish between inanimate nouns and
animate nouns, and within the animate nouns, between masculine and
feminine.  Any number of genders and the relationship between them can

requires overt subjects (<i>I studied</i>) whereas in Arabic the
corresponding sentence does not require a pronoun (<i>darastu</i>).
In languages which allow arugment dropping a marker is often attached
to the verb that contains all of the information that a pronoun
would--person, number, and gender.  This is not always the case,
however.  Japanese for instance allows subject dropping but does not
mark the verb for person, number or gender (Dryer 2008).</p>"
