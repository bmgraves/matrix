We might want to revine the NUMBER value for this example, if
the comment is accurate:

#Ex 24 illustrates agreement with a third person plural animate pronoun subject and a verb. For three or more, the suffix /-ka/ is added to verbs with both animate and inanimate subjects.  It precedes tense markers.  For animate subjects when /-ka/ is present the (non-sing) marker /-7um/ is optional.  Here it is given (Press 78).

Also, the example isn't parsing because of the form of

Similarly, we might want to adjust the NUMBER value for

Here (#25) the problem seems to be that the result lex rule
doesn't want the plural obj lex rule as an input.

Try removing this:

  verb-slot10_opt=on

That didn't work (same effect---clearly a bug in the slot code).
Try the other way around: make verb-slot10 optional, and then have
anything that selects for verb-slot10 and verb-slot8 only select
verb-slot10.  That gives this:

... because the -dtr types are all subtypes of avm, but this change
leads to rules that are infl-add-only-no-ccont-lex-rule, which somehow
gets [DTR word-or-lexrule].  What that isn't a problem more of the time
is puzzling to me just now.  I think the fix (in general) is to have
the -rule-dtr types inherit from word-or-lexrule.  But fixing that by
hand still doesn't solve the problem with #25.

I'm coming to the conclusion that #25 is hopeless with the current
system, but would be open to ideas from others!

#Ex 40 illustrates a grammatical negative sentence.  The negative is usually formed by adding a negative suffix (wa7i)to the main verb. The negative marker /kacu/ may also appear in the clause.  The negative does not occur with the present tense marker /-jI/, but it does occur with the past tense marker /-vII/. Here the optional negative marker /kac/ is also used.  /kac/ can appear almost anywhere in the sentence as long as the constraints on other morphemes are satisfied (Press 99).  There was no discussion about a difference in meaning when /kac/ was included.  The only comment was that it was often left out in colloquial speech.  In the book, it is classified as an adverb.

#Ex 44 illustrates a grammatical yes/no question.  Yes-No questions are formed by adding the enclitic /-raa/ to the first word in the sentence.  Since this test suite does not model bound subjects, this means that the question enclitic will always attach to the subject in this test suite.  It is important to note that this is not truly always the case.  When attached pronouns are present, /-raa/ precedes them.  The past tense marker /-vII/ does not occur in questions (Press 85).

The grammar is analyzing this one as necessarily taking the inanimate
agreement marker (zero morph). Maybe what's really going on is
that there's a marked form which is only compatible with animates
and an unmarked form which is underspecified?  Try removing
this slot (and renaming slot10 slot9 throughout).

  verb-slot9_name=inanimate-subj-agreement
  verb-slot9_order=after
    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot1

      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_value=inanimate
      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_head=subj

Just doing that leaves nukwi-jI as uninflected.  Try making
the slots that take slot1 (-jI) as input optional.

That saved 4 examples that weren't parsing before, but
added parses for 2 ungrammatical examples and made one
previously parsing example ambiguous.

One of the examples now parsing is this one:

#Ex 27 illustrates an ungrammatical use of the present tense for a [-mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [- mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).

I can't understand the comment, though, regarding whether
this is supposed to have -ji, -jI, or -0 as a tense
marking suffix.

Here is other new overgeneration example:

#Ex 33 illustrates an ungrammatical use of one of the perfectives "finish".  It is formed by adding /-ma7aku/.  It occurs with with /-vII/-past and the perfective enclitic /-caa/ (Press 68). Here neither the perfective enclitic /-caa/ nor the past /-vII/ is used.

-caa is not defined.  -vII is slot1, which can take 4, 5, 8
or 9 as input. -ma7aku is slot 5, and marked optional. In the
parse, the example is going through the nom-mom-pres-lex rule,
which is also slot1.  So something should make non-mom-pres-lex
and -ma7aku incompatible. 

The extra parse for an ungrammatical example is this one:

#Ex 23 illustrates agreement with a third person plural animate pronoun subject and a verb. For three or more, the suffix /-ka/ is added to verbs with both animate and inanimate subjects.  It precedes tense markers.  For animate subjects when /-ka/ is present the (non-sing) marker /-7um/ is optional.  Here it is not given (Press 78).

And the culprit is apparently this morpheme:

    verb-slot2_morph3_name=underspecified
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_name=number
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_value=non-dual

      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_name=gender
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_value=animate
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_head=subj

I'm not sure what this is doing.  If slot2 is obligatory
(which it isn't currently) then it needs a catch-all
option that will pass through anything not covered
by the other morphs.  If it's optional, it shouldn't
have any zero morphs in it.  Trying deleting 
that morph for now to see what happens. 

Taking that out reduced the spurious ambiguity, without
any other changes.

This one isn't parsing because no tense marker is attached.
I think a zero morpheme (perhaps restricted to a certain
verb type) is missing from the tense-marker slot, but I can't
really tell what's going on from the comment.

#Ex 28 illustrates a grammatical use of the present tense for a [+mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [- mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).

Here, the problem seems to be that the -ku rule is
ending up ltol, even though it is optional and not
the input for any other rule.  I think this is a bug
in the morphotactics code. A possible work-around is
to make it non-optional, and put a zero-morpheme in that
same slot with no effect.  I'll try that for now but
this is really not quite right :)

First attempt:

    verb-slot6_morph1_name=non-mom-zero-suffix
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_name=situation
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_value=mom-minus
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_head=verb

That doesn't help.  These two rules are still ltol,
which isn't the intended effect.

the plural morpheme looks like.

SS-Ex 13 interactive unification works.  I am not sure why the sentence does not parse.  Will ask about this tomorrow. 

Ex 28-- does not parse because the verb is prevented from going through the zero marker present tense rule for [+mom] verbs.  The lexical rules were defined incorrectly.  Perhaps, because the explanation given in the test suite had the situation reversed. [+mom] verbs must take the zero present tense marker [-mom] must take -jI as the present tense marker.  I think the lexical rules have this reversed.  I updated the comment part of the chemehuevi.txt, the examples themselves were correct.  

I changed 

verb-slot1_morph3_feat1_value=mom-minus to
verb-slot1_morph3_feat1_value=mom-plus

The names of these lexical rules should be changed as well to reflect the correct mom values.

Coverage stayed the same 51.9%, but there were changes in the details.

Ex 28 now parses
Ex 27 used to parse and shouldn't have.  Now it does not.
Ex 33 used to parse and shouldn't have.  Now it does not
Ex 36 is not parsing now and it should.  This is an example of a negative sentence, before the verb nukwi was allowed to go through the zero-marker present tense rule when it shouldn't have.  Now that it isn't allowed to go through this rule, this example is not parsing.

This parses now.

Coverage 18/27 66.7%
Overgeneration 3/30 10%

The detail report shows only the expected change.

Ex 30 contains an enclitic "-caa"that attaches to the subject.  It co-occurs with the perfective marker.  This is probably not possible to get.

Per Emily's comments, I think that 52 and 53 are the only ones left to try for.
The names "anni, johni, and margeti" were not in the lexicon.  I added them.

53 is now off the error list, but still not parsing.  I think that 52 is still or the list because it the coordination suffix attaches after the case marker.

Even though 53 is off of the error list, I don't see how to get the semantics correct for this.

Overgeneration


Ex 9 was overgenerating because number was underspecified for aipaci.  I added number singular as a feature for this noun type.  It is still overgenerating.  Here is a problem with the zero morpheme rules. 

Exs 12 and 48 were mislabeled as ungrammatical.  They were meant to be grammatical examples.  I changed the test suite and the item file.

Coverage: 20/29 69%
Overgeneration: 1/28 3.6%

8/20/09 ASF

simplified number hierarchy: non-singular and non-plural have (appropriate) subtypes dual, singular and plural. #9 is no longer parsed.

made one noun-class out of two for "mamI": grammar does not suggest they are separate pronouns, but one that can be dual or plural (i.e. non-singular) removed ambiguity on examples 10 and 26.

removed empty non-plural marker from verbal-morphemes and made this slot optional. Example 13 is now parsed, but #12 no longer receives the right "number". Since the interpretation seems to be a 'default' interpretation we don't really handle, this seems the most appropriate thing to do at this point.

verbal morphology could be modified a lot, but I am leaving it the way it is for now.

added a suffix -caa and an empty suffix to nouns (not adding any features) example 52 now parses (30 still does not) mystery why 52 all of a sudden works, but I am not complaining :-). Also added a zero morpheme to the verb, combining with -caa nouns and adding perfective aspect. #30 parses now.

added suffix -gai "subordinate" and vp-coordination strategy. #49 now parses, but so does #50. In the end, this coordination strategy does not work: it is a choice between slighty less coverage and overgeneration.
Since it would not have worked at all, if it were a transitive vp, I am considering removing it again.

removed coordination -su and -gai again: it would not work for transitives, and does not work properly for intransitives either (overgeneration).

added 'present tense' to zero marker to correct MRS of #34 and #36.
This is all we can do.

Summary of observations:

#2: Chemehuevi allows two word orders, this option is not supported by the matrix yet.
#40,#42: form of negation not handled (modifier + affix)
#44: second position question-marker is not handled yet
#49: coordination of phrases marked by affixes + form restrictions on one of the coordinands (neither is supported, hence #50 fails for the wrong reasons).

Failing for wrong reasons:
#41,#43: fails for the same reason as grammatical #40 and #42.
#45: fails for same reason as #44, restrictions on TAM imposed by question markers are not supported yet.
#50,#51:fail because of lacking -su coordination: restrictions on finiteness cannot be imposed in coordination library.

number and morpho-tactics: mostly work, there is just one point where the interaction does not: number can be marked at two places (both of which may provide a plural marker), but default interpretation is 'dual-sg'. It is not possible to add this with a zero-suffix at either number-slot, because it may end up in conflict with a plural marker. Number thus remains underspecified.
Negation: one strategy (affix) works, but strategy with optional negative marker in addition is not supported by the system.
word order: some things do work, but - was put here since the basic fact of Chemehuevi (word order is SOV or SVO) is not supported by the sytem.
yes-no questions: strategy second position clitic is not supported
v-coordination: affixal, the common pb.
