Grammar matrix v 0.1, January 27, 2002

This is an extremely preliminary first cut at the grammar
matrix.  It has not been tested except by being loaded into
the LKB.  It contains the following:

-- basic types which define the feature geometry
-- types for MRS semantics
-- underspecified supertypes of lexical rules
-- underspecified supertypes of phrase structure rules

Of these, the last were the most hastily thrown together.
They are basically taken from the syntax.tdl file of the LinGO
English grammar, and then simplified by removing constraints
that are either likely to be specific to English or are
related to the LinGO analysis of coordination.

These phrase structure rule types are of necessity underconstrained
and merely instantiating them will surely lead to a grammar
with gross overgeneration.  Thus, it is expected that they
will be either augmented directly, or via subtypes that fill
in some of the missing constraints.  One clear example of this
is the lack of constraints on the HEAD values in phrase structure
rules.  Since it's not clear what the appropriate 'universal'
head type hierachy will/could be, I've refrained from even 
defining types like 'verbal'...

Similarly, certain parts of the type hierarchy might need to be
modified.  In an ideal world, the matrix type hierarchy would only
need to be extended at the bottom for individual grammars.  However,
it is not clear that this is possible or desirable even in principle,
and it is certainly not the case for this preliminary first version!
(Defaults may help here...)

The single biggest gap in the matrix is the utter lack of
lexical types.  I hope that it can be useful even with this
huge lacuna.  Since the matrix holds so closely to the LinGO
grammar, the lexical types of the LinGO grammar should be 
used as models for creating lexical types.  Note in particular
that the rules assume lexical threading of NON-LOCAL features.
Beware that some feature names (notably HNDL) and many type names
differ between the matrix and the LinGO grammar, even when they
are logically and mnemonically related.
