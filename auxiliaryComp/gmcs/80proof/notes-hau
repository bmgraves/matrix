Problem:

Cycle involving TRANSITIVE-VERB-LEX

Repairs:

Changed the following:


  verb1_name=transitive -> verb1_name=trans
  verb2_name=intransitive -> verb2_name=intrans

New problem:

Added hyphen to suffix BFORM:

At least some examples we're losing because

LKB was token-breaking on ` (and turning ` into white space),

that gave itsdb problems (even though it worked interactively

There seems to be two problems with this one:

yaaròo baa ya-à gyaarà-CForm kèekè
boy NEG he-cont repair-CForm bicycle
The boy is not repairing a bicycle.


First, baa elsewhere is bàa. Second, there is
no auxiliary ya.  Maybe it was supposed to be
'yaa'.  It looks to me like this example is testing
phonology we don't handle.  Would it make sense to
have the morpheme segmented line regularize further?

SS--I began by looking at the first item that was coded as grammatical 
and did not parse.  I did a TSQL query in tsdb looking at well-formed and unanalyzed
items.

Example 1
yaaròo ya-nàa gyaarà-CForm kèekè
boy he-cont repair-CForm bicycle
The boy is repairing a bicycle.


I think that the problem is that "ya-" was coded as 2nd in the choices file.  It
should be 3rd.  I changed

verb-slot2_morph4_orth=ya-
      verb-slot2_morph4_feat2_value=2nd to

verb-slot2_morph4_orth=ya-
      verb-slot2_morph4_feat2_value=3rd

This example now parses.

I did the same query again and looked at the first item.  It seems that "dafa" boil was placed under intransitive verbs.  It should have been transitive.  I fixed this in te choices file.

hàdiizà taa dafà-CForm ruwaa
Hadiza(3fs) 3fs.COM boil-CForm water
Hadiza boiled water

This fixed it and the example now parses.

There are 38 positive items. 10 of these are now parsing.  Of the remaining 28

9 demonstrate two part negation which is not handled in the negation library 
(Items 4, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31)

7 reflect that independent pronouns do not appear as subjects (These examples are
of first and second person were a full NP is not possible).

(Items 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 32, 44)

For Item 33

yaaròo baa ya-à gyaarà-CForm kèeke
boy NEG he-cont repair-CForm bicycle
The boy is not repairing a bicycle.

The negative-continuous tense/aspect/mood aux needed to be added.  I put the following
in the choices file
 verb-slot2_input3_type=aux13

 aux13_name=negative-continuous-tam
  aux13_sem=no-pred
    aux13_feat1_name=aspect
    aux13_feat1_value=continuous

#Example 33 is an ungrammatical example of a negative-continous verb. The negative continous is formed by having the negative marker "bàa" followed by a pronoun containing the TAM "-à." "The complex made up of the negative marker plus the PAC exhibits a fixed H-L tome pattern.  Here the negative marker (incorrectly) comes after the pronoun +TAM.

The boy is not repairing a bicycle.
At first I thought this was happening because of 

neg-order=either

I changed it to neg-order=before and the problem still happened.

Now, I think this is overgenerating because the way the grammar is written the 
rule says it is allowed to come before a VP
"gyaarà kèekè" is a VP.  I do not know how to constrict it so that it only comes
before the aux.

Item 35 was partially not parsing because of a spelling convention.  If the weak
subject pronoun comes after the tense/aspect/mood aux, the convention is to write
them as two separate words.  Since we are regularizing spelling I changed this in
the test suite.  I also needed to add the suffix to the choices file (the other wsps
were prefixes.  This one is a suffix)

verb-slot3_name=suffix-light-syllable-wsp
      verb-slot3_opt=on
      verb-slot3_order=after

I do not think that the coordination library is able to eliminate this.


Item 55 should be looked at more as it as 5 different parses.  

Item 59 was not parsing because of an error in the test suite the lexical verbs
must end in a particular form.  In this case the -CForm had been left off.

Items 60 and 68 are questioning strategies that are not covered in the question
library. Item 60 uses a sentence final question morpheme and Item 68 uses a sentence
final word.  The word can be either sentence final or sentence initial and you must
choose either or.

I think that this is as far as Hausa will go.  Ambiguity for two items still needs to
be looked at.

SS-Implementing Argument Optionality
I added

subj-mark-drop=subj-mark-drop-req
subj-mark-no-drop=subj-mark-no-drop-req

Starting to look at Hausa: for now grammar does not load...tried with arg-opt, looking at without arg-opt. 
Without arg-opt loads. Looking whether I can find another choices file with arg-opt, else I will add it to the working regular choices file.

Correct files found. Checked MRSs: aspect is missing in #7, #8: added (by a somewhat hack, but could be done properly with knowledge of language). In example #39, mood is missing: this cannot be done.

Treebank Coverage 23/38

Not parsing grammatical examples:

#4, #24-#31: all due to not supported negation by double markers.
#41: not supported: word order alternation under specific conditions
#44: Auxiliary values tense and person number expressed by different auxiliaries: does not parse because of constraint on complement AUX - for semantically empty auxiliaries. (Additional bug: the comment explaining this appears in the grammar for each auxiliary type (17 times in this one).
Could also be typo in glosses (should zaa and -su be attached?)

with optionality:

Coverage: 63.2%, Treebank coverage: 57.9%
Overgeneration: 6.7%, Correctness Failure: 82.1%
Overall performance Ungrammatical examples: 76.7%
Spurious Ambiguity: 1 * 2p, 1 * 3p, 1* 4p, 1* 5p

Coordination: gets the right semantics, but spurious ambiguity occurs. One of the reasons being that the coordination marker may also occur by itself and coordination can be mono or polysyndeton: we can have a monosyndeton coordinated phrase that is complement of a coordination marker, which does not introduce another coordinand (structure [COORD [A COORD B] Verb] for instance).
NP's have the additional problem that the coordination marker can take the NP at different levels (pre- and post bare np) as a complement.

SS-Antske noticed that in Ex43 and 44 su is written as a separate word.  This is because it is combined with the the future TAM "zaa" which precedes it.  When the TAM precedes the wsp (weak subject pronoun) they are written as separate words.  Whether this is simply an orthographic convention is debatable. The reference grammar states that the support for considering them separate words is that modal particles can appear in between the TAM and wsp; however, the author goes on to state that he does not find this reason persuasive.  The example given in the book uses the modal particle "koo" which is translated as however.  Emily found this persuasive and decided that we should stick with treating them as separate words.

While constructing the test suite, I went back and forth as to what the correct analysis should be and thought that I had switched everything to having them be separate words, but I did not.  So, I changed Ex 35, 41, 59 to match the analysis that we are going with.  This means that we lose 2 sentences which had previously parsed.  Given the analysis Ex 35 is a true loss, but Ex 59 is really demonstrating coordination and is being lost because of the type of verb TAM that is used.  

This brings (non-arg-opt) coverage to 42.1%  Overgeneration stayed the same at 6.7%.
