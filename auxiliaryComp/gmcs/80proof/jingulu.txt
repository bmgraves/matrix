#Ex 22 demonstrates an intransitive verb that is formed using a "light verb."  If the coverbal root is not present, then the 3s marker appears. (Adapted from 169) This had been mistakenly constructed with the ergative marker present on an intransitive.  Intransitive subjects are absolutive (a:177).  There is focus marker that is homophonous with the ergative marker "-rni" which can appear with an intranstive subject (a:193-194)

#Ex 28 demonstrates verb subject agreement for transitive verbs.  Animate subjects of transitive verbs are in the ergative case. It is grammatical for dl and plural subjects/objects to take singular agreement markers.  Number disagreement is syntactically permissible. Semantically the "dual" trumps plural and plural trumps singular.  So here, the interpretation would default to the plural.
