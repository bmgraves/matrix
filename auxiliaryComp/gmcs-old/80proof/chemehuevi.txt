#Chemehuevi is a Uto-Aztecan language.  According to Ethnologue, other dialects include Ute and Southern Paiute. 
#Case-Nouns can be in the nominative or oblique case.  Nominative is the default case.  Press notes that final vowels are always dropped. Thus a for the noun stem "aipaci" the nominative surface form is "aipac." The oblique case marker is /-a/ for most nouns that do not end in /a/.  For nouns that end in /a/, the oblique case marker is /-ja/. There are also nouns which can take either case marker and nonproductive case-markers for certain words. Since the final vowel is dropped, the sign that a noun is oblique is the reappearance of the final vowel of the stem.  Thus "aipaci-a" is realized as "aipaci"(Press 53).  The morpheme by morpheme line uses the original stem before final vowel deletion.  

#Ex 1 illustrates a grammatical sentence with SOV word order. Based on a sentence from (Press 118) and vocab from (Press 120).  Subjects can appear as enclitics that can attach to verbs or objects.  I have not modeled that it the test suite.

#Ex 27 illustrates an ungrammatical use of the present tense for a [-mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [+mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).
