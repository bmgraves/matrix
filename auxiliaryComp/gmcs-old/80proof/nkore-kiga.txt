# Nkore(Nyankore, Runyankore) and Kiga (Rukiga, Chiga, Ciga) are Bantu languages spoken in Uganda.  The primary reference (a)  treats them as dialects of each other.  Like other Bantu languages, there is an elaborate class system for nouns.  The primary reference lists 17 different noun classes.  Three are modeled for agreement puporses in the test suite.  Pronouns are not normally used as subjects (or, I believe objects) unless emphasis is intended.  Normally the overt subject is dropped and only the subject prefix remains on the verb. Since emphasis is outside the scope of this project, I have only modeled the latter.

#Ex 43 demonstrates the perfect aspect.  Perfect aspect is formed by adding a form of the verb "be" "-ba" before the modified form of the main verb.  The modified form of the main verb is formed in several different ways depending on the verb stem.  I have simplified the representation here as simple suffixation of the "-ire" to the verb stem.  In practice, the process can be simple deletion of the final "a" of the original verb stem and addition of the suffix, or it can involve infixation of various affixes before the final consonant.
