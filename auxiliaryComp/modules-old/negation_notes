Questionnaire for user:

1. Does your language do sententential negation with an adverb, 
with inflection on the main verb, neither, both (one at a time),
or both together?

  inflection -> 2.
  adverb -> 4.
  both one at a time -> 2 then 4.
  neither -> sorry, can't help you today.
  both together -> sorry, can't help you today. 

	(Though I have some thoughts here: see two-part-neg-notes)

2. Is the negative marker a prefix or a suffix?

3. How are you spelling the negative marker in the abstract-morpheme
representation (= output of morphological analysis, suggested form
is NEG)?

  -> posit negation lexical rule with appropriate prefix or
  suffix, from infl-neg module.  Assume for now that sentences
  are always headed by verbs, so that inflectional sentential
  negation is verbal inflection.

4. Does the adverb attach to V, VP or S?  (Assume for now that
the answer will be only one, and not multiple -- otherwise, avoiding
spurious parses will become hairy.)

5. Does the adverb attach to the left or the right of the head
it is modifying, or both?

  -> Use these answers to posit a lexical entry which inherits
  from basic-scop-adv-lex, and is specified to have the right
  MOD, POSTHEAD, and KEY values.  Assume for now that these
  adverbs don't take complements or specifiers.
