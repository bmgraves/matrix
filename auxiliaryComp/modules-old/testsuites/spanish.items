; Spanish has:

; SVO order (and possibly also VSO, VOS, and OVS subject to pragmatics, but
; here we'll assume the non-SVO variants are enabled via syntactic 
; alternations).
; Typically the overt subject is omitted, but we ignore this here too.
; Human objects are marked with a 'personal' "a".
; Negation marked by selected adverb (selected by the verb)
; Yes-no questions marked by subject-verb inversion (assuming basic SVO order)
