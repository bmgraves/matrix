We shouldn't be outputting such tdl :)  (Though this is a choices

New error:

Feature MOOD is introduced at multiple types (TAM PNG)

It looks like mood is basically just a reflection
of SF, so I removed the feature and replaced all 
references to it (other than those that end up with
just [MOOD mood]) with [QUESTION plus] and [QUESTION minus]
respectively.  In some cases, the QUESTION feature was
already being used.  This probably isn't going to get
the facts right for indicative markers (e.g., the
indicative negative marker), since I don't think we're
doing anything with [QUESTION minus].

you.sing eat-already-inter-2s
'Have you already eaten?'

If -riir is a tense/aspect marker, we should add
a rule for it.  If it's an incorporated adverb,
then I guess this one's hopeless.

Added 3pl(subj) 3s(obj) marker:

    verb-slot4_morph11_name=3p-3s-subj-obj-marker
    verb-slot4_morph11_orth=-at
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat1_name=number

      verb-slot4_morph11_feat4_value=3rd
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat4_head=obj

But this one is still hopeless, because of non-retrofitted
coordination:

#Ex 47 demonstrates NP coordination. "Two NPs may be coordinated by enclitics "-lu" or "lunnitt" on the first constiuent of the last or on each NP in a stronger "both-and" or "either-or" sense" (a:126).

The note here doesn't make sense to me:

Corrected spelling of 2pl pronoun from illissi to ilissi
(to be consistent with choices file and the rest of the
test suite).

... that's still not parsing, apparently because there is
no appropriate case rule for the plural pronoun.  The zero
marked form says that it is singular.  

#Ex 66 demonstrates subject-object-verb agreement.

illit puisit pisarvasi

This one has a singular subject and plural agreement
marking, so the grammar is apparently correctly ruling it
out.  Replace with correct grammatical example? Also add
correct grammatical example?  Also, the 2s pronoun should
be illit, not illi.

More error analysis:

#Ex 7  demonstrates that an intransitive verb takes a subject in the absolutive case.  (I am not confident that the top line shows the proper spelling according to source b, if a verb base ends in a consonant "p" is used instead of "v".) Vocabulary for "qimmiq/dog" and "qilut/bark" taken from a:280

qimmiq qilutpuq
qimmiq qilut-vu-q
dog.abs bark-indic-3s
'The dog barked.'

The grammar thinks that qilut-vu-q is not fully inflected.  Apparently
the same problem with 10.

SS--I switched verb-slot1(intrans-indic-lex-rule) with verb-slot11. Now, qilut-vu-q is fully inflected.

This is very strange.

Ex 43 is unsupported coordination
Ex 51 was not parsing because of plural pronouns could not go through the case-marker-rule.

I created another rule for this based on the reference grammar, but this caused other examples where the pronoun was marked as -p for the absolutive that had been parsing to not parse.  

Apparently, I misanalyzed the case marking system for pronouns.  I thought that it was the same as nouns, but in another section it states that 1st and 2nd person pronouns do not have an overt marker for either the ergative/relative or absolutive cases.  In the test suite, the ergative/relative case is overtly marked on pronouns as "-p" similar to other nouns.

This may need to be changed.

Ex 70 was overgenerating because noun1 was left underspecified for person.

Added

noun1_feat1_name=person
    noun1_feat1_value=3rd

This may also fix 76.

Fixed 70 but not 76.

Ex 76 was supposed to ungrammatical, but the subjec/object marker used agreed with the subject and object.  I changed the test suite to make the example actually ungrammatical.

Added affixes and confirmed that they don't change coverage/overgen.)

Well-formed, unanalyzed, no error:

>43: No analysis of S coordination via affixation.  NP rule is attaching -lu, but of course that doesn't work.

Ill-formed, unanalyzed, no error:
Don't have time to go through these over slow connection right now.
Assuming they are in fact all ruled out for the right reason, but
we should check before final publication.
